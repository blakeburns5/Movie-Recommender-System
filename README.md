# Movie Recommendation Engine

A machine learning engine that will output movie recommendations to the user.

## Description

In this project, we create a movie recommendation system based on ratings and genre and
explore several algorithms and their performance in our system. These algorithms include
k-nearest neighbors and matrix factorization using singular value decomposition. We found that
the k-nearest neighbors algorithm consistently outperformed the singular value decomposition
algorithm.
